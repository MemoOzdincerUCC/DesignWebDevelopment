	How Education Links to Poverty; The Biased Condition of Property-based Funding:</h1>
<p class="introprgrph">When thinking about poverty and education, we're most likely able to identify that marginalized communities do not have access to the high quality education that wealthier communities might. There is a significant imbalance in the system. Having public schools accross the country that all have drastically different access to education might seem nonsensical at first. They all get funded equally from the government, right? Unfortunately, public schools in The US and Canada use a funding scheme that systematically reduces poor communities' access to quality education. This model is caled "Property Tax Based Funding." Essentially, it localizes school funding, by paying a school according to the value of the properties around it. Poorer communities, whose property tax is significantly lower than other communities are given access to poor education. This puts people who might already be in poorer situations in even tougher positions. Making their education, especially primary and secondary even more difficult compounds the effect of marginilization, as drop-out rates are significantly higher, and children who live in those communities have a much smaller chance of getting out. </p>
<h1>Statistics and Proof:</h1>

<p class="introprgrph">Although there is no direct statistics provided for Canada, this website will go over why the education imbalance occurs there as well. However, we are able to visualize the correlation between poor neighbourhoods and poor spending on public schools in The US, which gives us an idea of how clear and obvious this really is. In the two maps above, (poverty map on the left, school funding on the right), we can see a clear correlation between the two. With an exception of states with very small populations, and vast amounts of land (property tax laws vary there, and/or due to a lack of population, their funding might be state-based. Below, this webpage will go over how Canada deals with property tax based funding, and solutions to this problem.</p>

<p class="introprgrph">Above, there are two education structures: Ontario and Alberta. We can see that Ontario relies more heavily on property tax funding. This is because, the government of Canada announced in 2013 that they would be shifting from this structure into one that puts more emphasis on Provincial general revenue, rather than property taxes. Alberta is further ahead than Ontario because they have less districts to shift. However, all parts of Canada are working towards a less unequal structure. This ties into the different solutions for this problem, which will be highlighted below.
<h1>Solutions:</h1>
	<h2>#1. Adjusted Spending:</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5IEh588.png">	
<p class="introprgrph">Adjusted Spending is a solution proposed initially by Lauren Camera. This solutions puts primary emphasis on equity. Rather than replacing the current model, it suggests that we should support low-income children who can not benefit from the property-tax model. This method, although is the most viable, and most straightforward, it has received a lot of criticism. Education analysts, such as AmericanChange and The Guardian both claim that this solution targets the problem, not the source. The source, in this case, would be the impoverished communities. However, reducing poverty is perhaps one of the most difficult goals that The UN has. In my opinion, fixing education would be the opposite of ignoring the source. Allowing kids who live in poor communities to receive a high quality education with support will be a significant step in the right direction when eliminating poverty.</p>
	<h2>#2. Removing Property-Tax Based Funding:</h2>
<p class="introprgrph">Being perhaps the most obvious solution, removing property tax based funding has been a serious topic of discussion since the 1984. A paper that was released by Billy D. Walker influenced the masses, and gave them a perspective on the ugly side of education funding. Thus, he proposed removing property-tax based funding. If this has been being discussed since 1984, why can't we figure out a solution yet? Simply put, organization. The entirety of The US and Canada is built on a fragile structure. Infrastructure and flexibility is nonexistent. Furthermore, if property-tax was not used for education, it would inevitably increase other taxes. According to The US Ministry of education, this is the "most efficient, and viable" model. In many ways, this is true, however, it conforms to the backwards state of The US. As the rich do not want to pay extra taxes, they force the poor to deal with unequal education, and pay for it themselves. That being said, there is much evidence supporting this solution. Many countries outside of North America, in fact, do not use property-tax as a form of funding. In fact, they use significantly less of a budget as well. The US' greed, and appetite to feed the hungry has undermined any capability of equality.</p>
	<h2>#3. Academic-Based Funding:</h2>
<p class="introprgrph">Yet another broken system, academic-based funding. Currently, many counties in The US depending on their average GPA rating. This causes an extreme imbalance. Students who already do not achieve well in school, are given an even larger disadvantage. Furthermore, supporting teachers could allow them to create better environments for the students. Both in The US' and Canada, teachers being underpaid is an absolute crisis. In texas, an average school teacher gets paid only $6,000 above minimum wage a year. This creates resentment, and, in Canada, directly affected learning. Many teacher strikes in public schools took place, demanding for better working conditions, and better pay. This inspired students to protest as well. The "I should be in school" movement got started. These two protests were important stepping stones into creating a better environment for everyone to work in.</p><img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4366340.1554407505!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg">
